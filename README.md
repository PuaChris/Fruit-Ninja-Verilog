# Fruit-Ninja-FPGA
An imitation of the mobile game app "Fruit Ninja" coded through Verilog created by Chris Pua and Bruno Almeida

Using a De1-SoC board, mouse with a PS2 controller type port, and a monitor with VGA display, we recreated Fruit Ninja using the mouse to cut the "fruits". This project was completed over a period of 3 weeks
